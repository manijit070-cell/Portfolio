## Key Implementation Notes

- The light visual theme is driven by CSS variables in `src/index.css`.
- Project cards support optional external links through the `href` field in the `projects` data array.
- The Spline scene is lazy-revealed on desktop after idle time to keep the first render lighter.

## Deployment
